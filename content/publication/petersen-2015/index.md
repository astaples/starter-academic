abstract: Previous research has found associations but not established mechanisms
  of developmental linkage between language ability and inattentive-hyperactive (I-H)
  behavior problems. The present study examined whether self-regulation mediates the
  effect of language ability on later I-H behavior problems among young children (N
  = 120) assessed at 30, 36, and 42 months of age. Cross-lagged panel models tested
  the direction of effect between language ability and self-regulation and longitudinal
  effects of language ability on later I-H problems mediated by self-regulation. Language
  ability was measured by children's scores on the receptive and expressive language
  subtests of the Differential Ability Scales. Self-regulation was measured by three
  behavioral tasks requiring inhibitory control. I-H problems were reported by parents
  and secondary caregivers. Language ability predicted later self-regulation as measured
  by all three tasks. There was no association, however, between self-regulation and
  later language ability, suggesting that the direction of effect was stronger from
  language ability to later self-regulation. Moreover, the effect of language ability
  on later I-H behavior problems was mediated by children's self-regulation in one
  of the tasks (for secondary caregivers' but not parents' ratings). Findings suggest
  that language deficits may explain later I-H behavior problems via their prediction
  of poorer self-regulatory skills.
