abstract: "Background: Sleep is thought to be important for behavioral and cognitive\
  \ development. However, much of the prior research on sleep's role in behavioral/cognitive\
  \ development has relied upon self-report measures and cross-sectional designs.\
  \ Methods: The current study examined how early childhood sleep, measured actigraphically,\
  \ was developmentally associated with child functioning at 54 months. Emphasis was\
  \ on functioning at preschool, a crucial setting for the emergence of psychopathology.\
  \ Participants included 119 children assessed longitudinally at 30, 36, 42, and\
  \ 54 months. We examined correlations between child sleep and adjustment across\
  \ three domains: behavioral adjustment (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems),\
  \ socioemotional skills, and academic/cognitive abilities. We further probed consistent\
  \ associations with growth curve modeling. Results: Internalizing problems were\
  \ associated with sleep variability, and cognitive and academic abilities were associated\
  \ with sleep timing. Growth curve analysis suggested that children with more variable\
  \ sleep at 30 months had higher teacher-reported internalizing problems in preschool\
  \ and that children with later sleep timing at 30 months had poorer cognitive and\
  \ academic skills at 54 months. However, changes in sleep from 30 to 54 months were\
  \ not associated with any of the domains of adjustment. Conclusions: Findings indicate\
  \ that objectively measured sleep variability and late sleep timing in toddlerhood\
  \ are associated with higher levels of internalizing problems and poorer academic/cognitive\
  \ abilities in preschool."
