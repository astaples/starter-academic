abstract: The current study used event-related potentials to examine a candidate process
  through which sleep difficulties affect attentional processing in toddlers. Fifteen
  toddlers participated in an auditory Oddball task while neurophysiological data
  were collected. Sleep deficits were assessed using actigraphs, and attention was
  examined with a sustained attention task. A P3-like component was elicited from
  the toddlers, and longer target P3 latencies were associated with poorer sustained
  attention and irregular sleep. Findings suggest that irregular sleep is associated
  with less efficient attentional processing as reflected by the P3 component, and
  that longer target P3 latencies are associated with poorer sustained attention.
