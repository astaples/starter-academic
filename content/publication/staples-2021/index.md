abstract: There is increasing interest in the relation between screen use and sleep
  problems in early childhood. In a sample of 30-month-old children, this study used
  observational measures of screen use during the hour or so leading up to bedtime,
  parent-reports of screen use during the child's bedtime routine, and actigraphic
  measures of toddler sleep to complement parent-reported sleep problems. Whether
  screen use was observed during the pre-bedtime period or was reported by the parents
  as part of the nightly bedtime routine, greater screen use in either context was
  associated with more parent-reported sleep problems. Additionally, more frequent
  parent-reported screen use during the bedtime routine was also associated with actigraphic
  measures of later sleep, shorter sleep, and more night-to-night variability in duration
  and timing of sleep. These associations suggest the negative consequences of screen
  use for children's sleep extend beyond those aspects of sleep that are reliably
  observed by parents (e.g., bedtime resistance, signaled awakenings).
