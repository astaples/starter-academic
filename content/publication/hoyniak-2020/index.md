abstract: ABSTRACT Family processes during the pre-bedtime period likely have a crucial
  influence on toddler sleep, but relatively little previous research has focused
  on family process in this context. The current study examined several aspects of
  family process during the pre-bedtime period, including the use of bedtime routines,
  the qualities of the child?s home sleep environment, and the promotion of child
  emotional security, in families of 30-month-old toddlers (N= 546; 265 female) who
  were part of a multi-site longitudinal study of toddler development. These characteristics
  were quantified using a combination of parent- and observer-reports and examined
  in association with child sleep using correlation and multiple regression. Child
  sleep was assessed using actigraphy to measure sleep duration, timing, variability,
  activity, and latency. Bedtime routines were examined using parents? daily records.
  Home sleep environment and emotional security induction were quantified based on
  observer ratings and in-home observation notes, respectively. All three measures
  of pre-bedtime context (i.e., bedtime routine inconsistency, poor quality sleep
  environments, and emotional security induction) were correlated with various aspects
  of child sleep (significant correlations:.11-.22). The most robust associations
  occurred between the pre-bedtime context measures and sleep timing (i.e., the timing
  of the child?s sleep schedule) and variability (i.e., night to night variability
  in sleep timing and duration). Pre-bedtime variables, including bedtime routine
  consistency, home sleep environment quality, and positive emotional security induction,
  also mediated the association between family socioeconomic status and child sleep.
  Our findings underscore the value of considering family context when examining individual
  differences in child sleep.
