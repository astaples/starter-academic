abstract: Using data collected annually when children were in kindergarten through
  3(rd) grade (N = 478), this study investigated changes in mothers' use of nonharsh,
  harsh verbal, and physical discipline; changes in interparental conflict; and associations
  between changes in discipline and interparental conflict. Controlling for potential
  confounds, physical discipline decreased over the course of middle childhood, whereas
  harsh verbal and nonharsh discipline remained stable. Increases in interparental
  conflict were associated with increases in physical discipline; decreases in interparental
  conflict were associated with decreases in physical discipline. Change in interparental
  conflict was unrelated to change in harsh verbal or nonharsh discipline, although
  more frequent interparental conflict was associated with more frequen10t use of
  all three types of discipline in 1(st) grade. Findings extend previous research
  on how two major forms of communication within families-conflict between parents
  and parents' attempts to influence their children through discipline-change across
  middle childhood.
