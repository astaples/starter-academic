abstract: Despite a robust literature examining the association between sleep problems
  and cognitive abilities in childhood, little is known about this association in
  toddlerhood, a period of rapid cognitive development. The present study examined
  the association between various sleep problems, using actigraphy, and performance
  on a standardized test of cognitive abilities, longitudinally across three ages
  (30, 36, and 42 months) in a large sample of toddlers (N = 493). Results revealed
  a between-subject effect in which the children who had more delayed sleep schedules
  on average also showed poorer cognitive abilities on average but did not support
  a within-subjects effect. Results also showed that delayed sleep explains part of
  the association between family socioeconomic context and child cognitive abilities.
