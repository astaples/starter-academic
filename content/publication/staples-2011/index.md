abstract: Â© Oxford University Press, 2014. This chapter focuses on the consequences
  of sleep deficits for children between one and ten years of age. Research on adolescents
  and adults strongly suggests that sleep plays important roles in learning and behavior.
  Recent reviews suggest that less than optimal nighttime sleep is associated with
  less than optimal functioning during the day, particularly with respect to adults'
  learning, adolescents' academic performance, and attention deficit disorders in
  children. Likewise, sleep disordered breathing has been linked with cognitive functioning
  and emotions and behavior problems in children between the ages of four and sixteen
  years.
