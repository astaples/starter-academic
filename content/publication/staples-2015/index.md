abstract: The ability to transition from wakefulness to sleep is one of the most important
  tasks in the development of sleep during early childhood. Although establishing
  regular bedtime routines for children with sleep problems can be clinically effective
  in reducing the number of signaled night awakenings and increasing amount of sleep,
  it is unclear whether a regular bedtime routine would be associated with either
  the frequency of signaled night awakenings or nightly sleep minutes in a nonclinical
  sample of children. This study examined the role of a regular bedtime routine on
  the development of sleep regulation and consolidation in a community sample of young
  children. Adherence to a bedtime routine was concurrently associated with a greater
  amount of nightly sleep at 36 and 42 months. In addition, adherence to a bedtime
  routine predicted an increase in nightly sleep minutes over a 6-month period. Finally,
  this study demonstrated that adherence to a bedtime routine was particularly supportive
  of developmental gains for children of mothers who used consistent parenting practices
  during the day.
