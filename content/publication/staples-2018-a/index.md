abstract: "Parenting tasks change in relation to children's developing abilities.\
  \ This chapter considers parenting changes during the substantial period of children's\
  \ growth from birth to age three. The chapter reviews theories of parenting, and\
  \ then considers developmental tasks and challenges of parenting in three broad\
  \ domains: providing physical care and safety, structure and limits, and socialization.\
  \ The chapter considers the parenting challenge of how to identify and respond to\
  \ young children's developmentally changing needs. It also considers the challenge\
  \ of dealing with individual differences in children, particularly temperament characteristics.\
  \ Almost all of the research on parenting focuses on basic care and socialization\
  \ during the typical situations of daytime, such as eating, exploring, maintaining\
  \ safety, and playing. However, this chapter also considers research that has begun\
  \ to emerge on parenting in the context of dealing with children's need for sleep.\
  \ Finally, the chapter considers suggestions for future research and implications\
  \ for policy and practice."
