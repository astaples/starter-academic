abstract: 'Objective: Substance use disorders and behavioral addictions commonly co-occur.
  However, few available self-report measures reliably and validly assess the full
  range of addictive conditions. The development and initial validation of a new measure---Recognizing
  Addictive Disorders (RADs) scale addresses a significant gap in the literature.
  Method: After items were generated and evaluated in Study 1, Study 2 (N = 300),
  applied exploratory factor analysis to the item pool using an online-based community
  sample. In Study 3 (N = 427), the factor structure was validated using an independent
  online-based community sample and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The scale
  demonstrated good internal consistency (a =.92) and construct validity, including
  replication of the factor structure ($Ï‡$2 (553) = 760.83, p textless.001, CFI =.997,
  TLI =.997, RMSEA =.030) and correlation with a related transdiagnostic measure of
  addiction (r =.72). Discussion: Overall, results support the preliminary validity
  of a brief transdiagnostic measure of addiction that considers a diverse range of
  behaviors. For patients presenting to substance abuse treatment, this tool may be
  useful in identifying symptoms of other types of non-substance problems, which could
  ultimately aid in treatment planning.'
