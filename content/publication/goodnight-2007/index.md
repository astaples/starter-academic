abstract: This study examined the moderating effects of temperamental resistance to
  control on the link between development of sleep problems and development of externalizing
  behaviors over a 5-year period. Resistance to control was assessed with mothers'
  retrospective reports of temperament in infancy, provided when children were 5 years
  of age. Sleep problems were assessed with mother reports on an annual basis from
  age 5 to age 9. Externalizing behaviors were assessed with teacher reports on an
  annual basis from age 5 to age 9. A cross-domain latent growth curve model indicated
  that sleep problem trajectories were positively associated with externalizing behavior
  trajectories only for children high in resistance to control. In addition, resistance
  to control was positively associated with initial (age 5) sleep problems and initial
  (age 5) externalizing behaviors. The authors speculate that the development of sleep
  problems promotes the development of behavior problems for resistant children, whose
  self-regulatory abilities are especially tenuous. Implications for prevention and
  treatment of conduct problems are considered.
