abstract: Inhibitory control is thought to demonstrate heterotypic continuity, in
  other words, continuity in its purpose or function but changes in its behavioral
  manifestation over time. This creates major methodological challenges for studying
  the development of inhibitory control in childhood including construct validity,
  developmental appropriateness and sensitivity of measures, and longitudinal factorial
  invariance. We meta-analyzed 198 studies using measures of inhibitory control, a
  key aspect of self-regulation, to estimate age ranges of usefulness for each measure.
  The inhibitory control measures showed limited age ranges of usefulness owing to
  ceiling/floor effects. Tasks were useful, on average, for a developmental span of
  less than 3 years. This suggests that measuring inhibitory control over longer spans
  of development may require use of different measures at different time points, seeking
  to measure heterotypic continuity. We suggest ways to study the development of inhibitory
  control, with overlapping measurement in a structural equation modeling framework
  and tests of longitudinal factorial or measurement invariance. However, as valuable
  as this would be for the area, we also point out that establishing longitudinal
  factorial invariance is neither sufficient nor necessary for examining developmental
  change. Any study of developmental change should be guided by theory and construct
  validity, aiming toward a better empirical and theoretical approach to the selection
  and combination of measures.
