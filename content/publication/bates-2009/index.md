abstract: Â© Cambridge University Press 2009. The field of developmental psychopathology
  (Achenbach, 1974; Sroufe & Rutter, 1984) identifies risk factors and models the
  processes by which risks relate to behavior problems. One type of model posits that
  risks add in a linear way to increase the chances that a child will develop problems.
  This type of model has been well supported. Research to date has established that
  adverse rearing conditions, such as excessively hostile parenting or poverty (e.g.,
  Rothbaum & Weisz, 1994), and adverse personal qualities of children, such as neurological
  dysfunctions or difficult temperament (Moffitt, 1993; Rothbart & Bates, 2006), are
  correlated with behavior problem outcomes. The more such adversities are present,
  the stronger the prediction of later behavior problems (Appleyard, Egeland, van
  Dulmen, & Sroufe, 2005; Deater-Deckard, Dodge, Bates, & Pettit, 1998). Some additive
  risk models postulate mediating factors and thus provide a more satisfying account
  of developmental process; for example, the experience of physical abuse leads to
  deviant social cognition, which, in turn, leads to aggressive behavior (Dodge, Bates,
  & Pettit, 1990; Dodge, Pettit, Bates, & Valente, 1995). However, linear combinations
  of even relatively large numbers of predictors tend to account for less than half
  of the variance in behavioral adjustment (e.g., Deater-Deckard et al., 1998). Part
  of this shortcoming may be due to failure to specify enough of the many possible
  risk factors.
